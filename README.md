## Description

Artsy is a real time miltiplayer drawing game. One person draws a word given to them and the other plays have to guess what is being drawn.

## How to play:
    1. Log in or create an account with a username
    2. Click Join a game from the Home page
    3. Enter a Room and Name to join a game
    4. Once joined there will be a random word seen on the screen for someone to draw and the others have to guess.

## Future Updates
    1.The first person to join a room will be set to the host and get a random word to draw. Currently everyone who joins will be able to see a random word and draw on the page.
    2.The person to correct the right word will gain points and be set to the drawer for the next round.
    3. Points will be awarded to the person who guesses the correct drawing.
    4. Leader Board on past wins/score
    5. Add a timer for the drawer
